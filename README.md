# Code for: *[Data Harmonization Via Regularized Nonparametric Mixing Distribution Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06077)*

This repository contains the code used in the paper *"Data Harmonization Via Regularized Nonparametric Mixing Distribution Estimation."*

## Installation

You can install the development version of the `dnoiseR` package, which is used to generate the results in the paper, directly from GitHub:

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SteveJWR/dnoiseR")
```


## Running the Code 
All code required to generate the figures in the paper is included in the `R/` folder. Scripts are numbered sequentially according to their appearance in the manuscript.

The National Alzheimerâ€™s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set is included in the `data/` folder. It is also publicly available [here](https://naccdata.org/data-collection/forms-documentation/uds-3).
